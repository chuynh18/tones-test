#Keyboard prototype

This is just a quick and dirty keyboard prototype.  I'm playing around with SVG methods and Web Audio API methods before I spend time building what I've been thinking about for a while:  A toy keyboard that can be used to input music and play it back later.  The real thing, if built, will be done in TypeScript.
