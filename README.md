# Keyboard prototype

This is just a quick and dirty keyboard prototype.  I'm playing around with SVG methods and Web Audio API methods before I spend time building what I've been thinking about for a while:  A toy keyboard that can be used to input music and play it back later.  ~The real thing, if built, will be done in TypeScript.~

lies it's all javascript

and now it also plays (some) MIDI files - MIDI parsing code written from scratch. WELL everything was written from scratch
NO AI
NO FRAMEWORKS
NO EXTERNAL LIBRARIES

Piano sounds from https://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html

Piano SVG from... I forgot, but it only had 12 keys so I duplicated them in Inkscape to get all 88 keys
